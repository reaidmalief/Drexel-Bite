Hi, I'm Reaid Mottakin Alief, an international student studying Computer Science at Drexel University. My interests lie in programming and web development, and I have a foundational knowledge of languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm continuously expanding my knowledge by taking on coding challenges and learning new concepts every day. I'm considering a minor in Software Engineering and aspire to become a full-stack developer in the future.
