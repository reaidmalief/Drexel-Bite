## Setup <a name="setup"></a>
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the project's GitHub repository:
   ```
   git clone 
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd project-name
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Configure the project by setting up the required environment variables. Refer to the `.env.example` file for the list of variables and their values.
5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
6. Open your preferred web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>
To run the tests for the project, use the following command:
```
npm test
```
This will execute the test suite and provide feedback on the test results.

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>
To deploy the application to a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Build the optimized production-ready code:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
2. Configure the deployment settings based on the hosting platform or server you are using. Refer to the deployment documentation for specific instructions.
3. Deploy the built code to the target environment.

## Codebase Changes <a name="codebase-changes"></a>
When making changes to the codebase, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make the necessary changes to the code.
3. Write tests for your code to ensure proper functionality.
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```
5. Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. Open a pull request in the repository and request a code review from the team.
